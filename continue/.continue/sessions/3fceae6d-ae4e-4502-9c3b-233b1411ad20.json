For implementing changes, use the edit tools.\n\n</important_rules>\n\n<tool_use_instructions>\nYou have access to several \"tools\" that you can use at any time to retrieve information and/or perform tasks for the User.\nTo use a tool, respond with a tool code block (```tool) using the syntax shown in the examples below:\n\nThe following tools are available to you:\n\nTo read a file with a known filepath, use the read_file tool. For example, to read a file located at 'path/to/file.txt', you would respond with this:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: read_file\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/the_file.txt\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo create a NEW file, use the create_new_file tool with the relative filepath and new contents. For example, to create a file located at 'path/to/file.txt', you would respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: create_new_file\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/the_file.txt\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: contents\nContents of the file\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo run a terminal command, use the run_terminal_command tool\nThe shell is not stateful and will not remember any previous commands.      When a command is run in the background ALWAYS suggest using shell commands to stop it; NEVER suggest using Ctrl+C.      When suggesting subsequent shell commands ALWAYS format them in shell command blocks.      Do NOT perform actions requiring special/admin privileges.      Choose terminal commands and scripts optimized for linux and x64 and shell /usr/bin/zsh.\nYou can also optionally include the waitForCompletion argument set to false to run the command in the background.      \nFor example, to see the git log, you could respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: run_terminal_command\nBEGIN_ARG: command\ngit log\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo return a list of files based on a glob search pattern, use the file_glob_search tool\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: file_glob_search\nBEGIN_ARG: pattern\n*.py\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo view the current git diff, use the view_diff tool. This will show you the changes made in the working directory compared to the last commit.\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: view_diff\n```\n\nTo view the user's currently open file, use the read_currently_open_file tool.\nIf the user is asking about a file and you don't see any code, use this to check the current file\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: read_currently_open_file\n```\n\nTo list files and folders in a given directory, call the ls tool with \"dirPath\" and \"recursive\". For example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: ls\nBEGIN_ARG: dirPath\npath/to/dir\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: recursive\nfalse\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nSometimes the user will provide feedback or guidance on your output. If you were not aware of these \"rules\", consider using the create_rule_block tool to persist the rule for future interactions.\nThis tool cannot be used to edit existing rules, but you can search in the \".continue/rules\" folder and use the edit tool to manage rules.\nTo create a rule, respond with a create_rule_block tool call and the following arguments:\n- name: Short, descriptive name summarizing the rule's purpose (e.g. 'React Standards', 'Type Hints')\n- rule: Clear, imperative instruction for future code generation (e.g. 'Use named exports', 'Add Python type hints'). Each rule should focus on one specific standard.\n- description: Description of when this rule should be applied. Required for Agent Requested rules (AI decides when to apply). Optional for other types.\n- globs: Optional file patterns to which this rule applies (e.g. ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'] or ['src/**/*.ts', 'tests/**/*.ts'])\n- alwaysApply: Whether this rule should always be applied. Set to false for Agent Requested and Manual rules. Omit or set to true for Always and Auto Attached rules.\nFor example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: create_rule_block\nBEGIN_ARG: name\nUse PropTypes\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: rule\nAlways use PropTypes when declaring React component properties\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: description\nEnsure that all prop types are explicitly declared for better type safety and code maintainability in React components.\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: globs\n**/*.js\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: alwaysApply\nfalse\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo fetch the content of a URL, use the fetch_url_content tool. For example, to read the contents of a webpage, you might respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: fetch_url_content\nBEGIN_ARG: url\nhttps://example.com\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo edit an EXISTING file, use the edit_existing_file tool with\n- filepath: the relative filepath to the file.\n- changes: Any modifications to the file, showing only needed changes. Do NOT wrap this in a codeblock or write anything besides the code changes. In larger files, use brief language-appropriate placeholders for large unmodified sections, e.g. '// ... existing code ...'\nOnly use this tool if you already know the contents of the file. Otherwise, use the read_file or read_currently_open_file tool to read it first.\nFor example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: edit_existing_file\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/the_file.ts\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: changes\n// ... existing code ...\nfunction subtract(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a - b;\n}\n// ... rest of code ...\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo perform exact string replacements in files, use the single_find_and_replace tool with a filepath (relative to the root of the workspace) and the strings to find and replace.\n\n  For example, you could respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: single_find_and_replace\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/file.ts\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: old_string\nconst oldVariable = 'value'\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: new_string\nconst newVariable = 'updated'\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: replace_all\nfalse\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo perform a grep search within the project, call the grep_search tool with the query pattern to match. For example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: grep_search\nBEGIN_ARG: query\n.*main_services.*\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nIf it seems like the User's request could be solved with one of the tools, choose the BEST one for the job based on the user's request and the tool descriptions\nThen send the ```tool codeblock (YOU call the tool, not the user). Always start the codeblock on a new line.\nDo not perform actions with/for hypothetical files. Ask the user or use tools to deduce which files are relevant.\nYou can only call ONE tool at at time. The tool codeblock should be the last thing you say; stop your response after the tool codeblock.\n</tool_use_instructions>\n\n<user>\ncheck this file and give feedback\n\n",

        "content": "**Feedback on `build_files/base/17‑cleanup.sh`**\n\nOverall the script is well‑structured, idempotent where possible, and follows good practices (e.g., `set -eoux pipefail`, grouping output for CI). Below are some observations, suggestions, and minor improvements you might consider.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Shebang & Execution Environment\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/bash\n```\n* **Suggestion:** Use `/usr/bin/env bash` to be more portable across distributions that may place Bash in a different location.\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. CI Grouping Header\n```bash\necho \"::group:: ===$(basename \"$0\")===\"\n```\n* Works fine for GitHub Actions. If you ever run this script outside of GH Actions, the `::group::` syntax will just be printed – that’s harmless.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Disabling uupd module injection\n```bash\nsed -i 's|uupd|& --disable-module-distrobox|' /usr/lib/systemd/system/uupd.service\n```\n* **Potential issue:** Running `sed` on a system‑wide unit file may break the package manager’s ability to upgrade that unit later (the change will be overwritten).  \n  *If you control the image build and this is intentional, it’s fine. Otherwise consider creating an override drop‑in instead:*\n```bash\nmkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/uupd.service.d\ncat > /etc/systemd/system/uupd.service.d/disable-distrobox.conf <<'EOF'\n[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/usr/libexec/uupd --disable-module-distrobox …\nEOF\nsystemctl daemon-reload\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. `set -eoux pipefail`\n* Good for early failure detection.\n* **Tip:** If you later add commands that intentionally may fail (e.g., disabling a service that might not exist), wrap them with `|| true` or use `if ...; then …; fi`.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Enabling Services\n```bash\nsystemctl enable rpm-ostree-countme.service\n...\nsystemctl --global enable podman-auto-update.timer\n```\n* **Consistency:** You mix plain `enable` and `--global enable`. It’s clear you want some services system‑wide and others for the user. Consider adding a comment block separating *system* vs *user* services for readability.\n* **Idempotency:** `systemctl enable` is already idempotent, so no extra checks needed.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Disabling/Enabling Flatpak Repos & Services\n```bash\nflatpak remote-add --system --if-not-exists flathub …\nsystemctl disable flatpak-add-fedora-repos.service\n```\n* Good use of `--if-not-exists`.  \n* You might also want to ensure the *flathub* repo is trusted (e.g., verify its GPG key) if this runs on a fresh image.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Loop Over Desktop Files\n```bash\nfor file in htop nvtop; do\n    if [[ -f \"/usr/share/applications/${file}.desktop\" ]]; then\n        desktop-file-edit --set-key=Hidden --set-value=true /usr/share/applications/${file}.desktop\n    fi\ndone\n```\n* Works, but consider using `command -v desktop-file-edit >/dev/null || continue` to avoid errors if the utility isn’t installed.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Repo Disabling Logic\nYou have many loops that replace `enabled=1` with `enabled=0`. A few points:\n\n| Observation | Recommendation |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| Repeated `sed -i 's@enabled=1@enabled=0@g' …` patterns | Extract to a small helper function for readability, e.g., `disable_repo() { sed -i 's@enabled=1@enabled=0@g' \"$1\"; }`. |\n| Using glob loops (`for i in /etc/yum.repos.d/_copr:*.repo; do …`) – if the glob doesn’t match any file, Bash will iterate over the literal pattern. | Add `shopt -s nullglob` at the top (or before each loop) to avoid processing non‑existent patterns. |\n| Some repos are disabled twice (`rpmfusion-*.repo` already covered by generic “disable all COPR repos” logic). | Not harmful, but you could consolidate to a single “disable everything under `/etc/yum.repos.d/` that contains `enabled=1`”. |\n| Hard‑coded repo names (e.g., `negativo17-fedora-multimedia`). If the upstream changes name, script will silently skip. | Consider adding a comment noting that these are expected to exist for the target base image. |\n\n**Example helper:**\n```bash\ndisable_repo_file() {\n    local file=$1\n    [[ -f \"$file\" ]] && sed -i 's@enabled=1@enabled=0@g' \"$file\"\n}\n```\nThen:\n```bash\nfor repo in negativo17-fedora-multimedia tailscale fedora-cisco-openh264; do\n    disable_repo_file \"/etc/yum.repos.d/${repo}.repo\"\ndone\n```\n\n---\n\n### 9. Safety Checks Before `sed` on System Files\nAll `sed -i` commands assume the file is writable. In a typical image build environment this is fine, but if you ever run the script in a hardened container where `/etc/yum.repos.d/` is read‑only, it will abort because of `set -e`.  \n*Potential mitigation:* Wrap each `sed` in a conditional that checks write permission:\n```bash\n[[ -w \"$file\" ]] && sed -i 's@enabled=1@enabled=0@g' \"$file\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 10. End‑Group Marker\n```bash\necho \"::endgroup::\"\n```\n* Good – matches the opening group.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Suggested Changes\n\n| Area | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| Shebang | Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` |\n| uupd service modification | Prefer a systemd drop‑in override instead of editing the unit file directly |\n| Repo‑disable loops | Add `shopt -s nullglob`; optionally create a helper function to reduce repetition |\n| Desktop file edit | Guard against missing `desktop-file-edit` binary |\n| Comments & organization | Separate sections (system services, user services, repo cleanup) with clear headings |\n| Optional safety checks | Verify write permission before mutating files |\n\nIf you’d like me to apply any of these changes directly to the script, just let me know which ones and I’ll edit the file for you."

For implementing changes, use the edit tools.\n\n</important_rules>\n\n<tool_use_instructions>\nYou have access to several \"tools\" that you can use at any time to retrieve information and/or perform tasks for the User.\nTo use a tool, respond with a tool code block (```tool) using the syntax shown in the examples below:\n\nThe following tools are available to you:\n\nTo read a file with a known filepath, use the read_file tool. For example, to read a file located at 'path/to/file.txt', you would respond with this:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: read_file\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/the_file.txt\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo create a NEW file, use the create_new_file tool with the relative filepath and new contents. For example, to create a file located at 'path/to/file.txt', you would respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: create_new_file\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/the_file.txt\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: contents\nContents of the file\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo run a terminal command, use the run_terminal_command tool\nThe shell is not stateful and will not remember any previous commands.      When a command is run in the background ALWAYS suggest using shell commands to stop it; NEVER suggest using Ctrl+C.      When suggesting subsequent shell commands ALWAYS format them in shell command blocks.      Do NOT perform actions requiring special/admin privileges.      Choose terminal commands and scripts optimized for linux and x64 and shell /usr/bin/zsh.\nYou can also optionally include the waitForCompletion argument set to false to run the command in the background.      \nFor example, to see the git log, you could respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: run_terminal_command\nBEGIN_ARG: command\ngit log\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo return a list of files based on a glob search pattern, use the file_glob_search tool\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: file_glob_search\nBEGIN_ARG: pattern\n*.py\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo view the current git diff, use the view_diff tool. This will show you the changes made in the working directory compared to the last commit.\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: view_diff\n```\n\nTo view the user's currently open file, use the read_currently_open_file tool.\nIf the user is asking about a file and you don't see any code, use this to check the current file\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: read_currently_open_file\n```\n\nTo list files and folders in a given directory, call the ls tool with \"dirPath\" and \"recursive\". For example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: ls\nBEGIN_ARG: dirPath\npath/to/dir\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: recursive\nfalse\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nSometimes the user will provide feedback or guidance on your output. If you were not aware of these \"rules\", consider using the create_rule_block tool to persist the rule for future interactions.\nThis tool cannot be used to edit existing rules, but you can search in the \".continue/rules\" folder and use the edit tool to manage rules.\nTo create a rule, respond with a create_rule_block tool call and the following arguments:\n- name: Short, descriptive name summarizing the rule's purpose (e.g. 'React Standards', 'Type Hints')\n- rule: Clear, imperative instruction for future code generation (e.g. 'Use named exports', 'Add Python type hints'). Each rule should focus on one specific standard.\n- description: Description of when this rule should be applied. Required for Agent Requested rules (AI decides when to apply). Optional for other types.\n- globs: Optional file patterns to which this rule applies (e.g. ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'] or ['src/**/*.ts', 'tests/**/*.ts'])\n- alwaysApply: Whether this rule should always be applied. Set to false for Agent Requested and Manual rules. Omit or set to true for Always and Auto Attached rules.\nFor example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: create_rule_block\nBEGIN_ARG: name\nUse PropTypes\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: rule\nAlways use PropTypes when declaring React component properties\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: description\nEnsure that all prop types are explicitly declared for better type safety and code maintainability in React components.\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: globs\n**/*.js\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: alwaysApply\nfalse\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo fetch the content of a URL, use the fetch_url_content tool. For example, to read the contents of a webpage, you might respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: fetch_url_content\nBEGIN_ARG: url\nhttps://example.com\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo edit an EXISTING file, use the edit_existing_file tool with\n- filepath: the relative filepath to the file.\n- changes: Any modifications to the file, showing only needed changes. Do NOT wrap this in a codeblock or write anything besides the code changes. In larger files, use brief language-appropriate placeholders for large unmodified sections, e.g. '// ... existing code ...'\nOnly use this tool if you already know the contents of the file. Otherwise, use the read_file or read_currently_open_file tool to read it first.\nFor example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: edit_existing_file\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/the_file.ts\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: changes\n// ... existing code ...\nfunction subtract(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a - b;\n}\n// ... rest of code ...\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo perform exact string replacements in files, use the single_find_and_replace tool with a filepath (relative to the root of the workspace) and the strings to find and replace.\n\n  For example, you could respond with:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: single_find_and_replace\nBEGIN_ARG: filepath\npath/to/file.ts\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: old_string\nconst oldVariable = 'value'\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: new_string\nconst newVariable = 'updated'\nEND_ARG\nBEGIN_ARG: replace_all\nfalse\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nTo perform a grep search within the project, call the grep_search tool with the query pattern to match. For example:\n```tool\nTOOL_NAME: grep_search\nBEGIN_ARG: query\n.*main_services.*\nEND_ARG\n```\n\nIf it seems like the User's request could be solved with one of the tools, choose the BEST one for the job based on the user's request and the tool descriptions\nThen send the ```tool codeblock (YOU call the tool, not the user). Always start the codeblock on a new line.\nDo not perform actions with/for hypothetical files. Ask the user or use tools to deduce which files are relevant.\nYou can only call ONE tool at at time. The tool codeblock should be the last thing you say; stop your response after the tool codeblock.\n</tool_use_instructions>\n\n<user>\ncheck this file and give feedback\n\n<assistant>\nLet's read current file.<|channel|>commentary to=tool code<|message|>{\n  \"TOOL_NAME\": \"read_currently_open_file\"\n}\n\n<user>\nok\n\n<assistant>\n<|channel|>commentary to=tool code<|message|>{\n  \"TOOL_NAME\": \"view_diff\"\n}\n\n<user>\n```build_files/base/17-cleanup.sh\n#!/usr/bin/bash\n\necho \"::group:: ===$(basename \"$0\")===\"\n\n# Disable uupd from updating distroboxes\nsed -i 's|uupd|& --disable-module-distrobox|' /usr/lib/systemd/system/uupd.service\n\nset -eoux pipefail\n\n# Setup Systemd\nsystemctl enable rpm-ostree-countme.service\nsystemctl enable tailscaled.service\nsystemctl enable dconf-update.service\nsystemctl enable ublue-guest-user.service\nsystemctl enable brew-setup.service\nsystemctl enable brew-upgrade.timer\nsystemctl enable brew-update.timer\nsystemctl enable aurora-groups.service\nsystemctl enable usr-share-sddm-themes.mount\nsystemctl enable ublue-fix-hostname.service\nsystemctl enable ublue-system-setup.service\nsystemctl --global enable ublue-user-setup.service\nsystemctl --global enable podman-auto-update.timer\nsystemctl enable check-sb-key.service\nsystemctl enable input-remapper.service\n\n# Nuke possible Fedora flatpak repos\nsystemctl enable flatpak-nuke-fedora.service\n\n# TODO: Reinvestigate when bazaar gains dbus activation\nsystemctl --global enable bazaar.service\n\n# run flatpak preinstall once at startup\nsystemctl enable flatpak-preinstall.service\n\n# disable sunshine service\nsystemctl --global disable sunshine.service\n\n# Updater\nsystemctl enable uupd.timer\n\n# Disable the old update timer\nsystemctl disable rpm-ostreed-automatic.timer\nsystemctl disable flatpak-system-update.timer\n\n# Hide Desktop Files.
